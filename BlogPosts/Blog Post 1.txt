Rollerball:

Over covid I began learning how Unity worked.
I went through the stages of creating 2D games, but since 2020 I haven't been back to play with it.

Rollerball gave me a reminder of the general workflow of making a game, but I hadn't spent much time making 3D games.
I was not as comforatable making 3D surfaces for the ball to roll on, however I did get a reminder of several parts of Unity, such as:

creating a plane
scripting in c#
creating a player controlled object
building a play space
making prefabs
basic UI to reflect game state

Although I had previously done all of these by following a course on 2D Unity game development, it was an interesting experience to go back several years later after 3 years of coding.

These will be useful as I progress in creating my game.
